### Spec changes

Changes to the specification text or schemas require a public review period before merging. This ensures the community
has time to review and provide feedback on changes that affect the standard. See
the [Versioning Policy](/governance/versioning/) for how changes are categorized.

## What can you contribute?

- **Spec clarifications and errata** — fix ambiguities or errors in the spec text
- **Provider mappings** — add or update [importer mappings](/providers/overview/) for new or changed provider exports
- **Schema improvements** — backwards-compatible additions (new optional fields, new types)
- **Documentation** — improve guides, examples, or reference pages
- **Tools and validators** — build converters, validators, or libraries
