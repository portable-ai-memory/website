description: Annotated PAM examples covering minimal files, conversations, relations, embeddings, and full memory stores
---

These examples show PAM files at increasing levels of complexity. Start with the minimal example and work your way up.

1. **[Minimal](/examples/minimal/)** — The smallest valid PAM file with a single memory entry
2. **[Complete Memory Store](/examples/complete-memory-store/)** — Full example with multiple memory types, relations,
   and integrity block
3. **[Conversation](/examples/conversation/)** — Normalized conversation imported from a provider
4. **[With Relations](/examples/with-relations/)** — Demonstrating semantic relationships between memories
5. **[With Embeddings](/examples/with-embeddings/)** — Companion embeddings file for vector search
