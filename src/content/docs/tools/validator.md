:::caution[Coming Soon]
The online PAM validator is under development.
:::

The PAM Validator will allow you to paste or upload a PAM JSON file and validate it against the schema directly in the
browser. It will provide detailed error reports showing exactly which fields fail validation and why.

In the meantime, you can validate locally using `ajv-cli`. See the [Validation Guide](/tools/validation-guide/) for
instructions.
